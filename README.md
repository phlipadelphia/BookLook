# BookLook
A Book Search Engine Utilizing The Best of MERN

## About
For this project I was provided with some starter code, from there I began to refactor the API's throughout to use GraphQL on the back end. Additionally I added some functionality on the front end by modifying files on both ends. The Auth.js, Server.js and Schemas needed adjustments on the back end. On the front end, I created Queries.js and Mutations.js in addition to adjusting pre-existing js files such as SavedBooks and SearchBooks, with mutation and query hooks. 

## My Task
Your assignment this week is emblematic of the fact that most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This week, youâ€™ll take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. It's already set up to allow users to save book searches to the back end.
